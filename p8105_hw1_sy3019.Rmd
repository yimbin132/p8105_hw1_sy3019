# Problem 1 

## Importing data
```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
penguins_df = janitor::clean_names(penguins)
```

## Take a look at the data
```{r}
penguins_df
```
```{r}
skimr::skim(penguins_df)
```
The penguins data frame has "species," "island," and "sex" string values, and "bill_length_mm," "bill_depth_mm," "flipper_length_mm," 
"body_mass_g," and "year" numeric variables. There are `r nrow(penguins_df)` rows, and `r ncol(penguins_df)` columns, and the mean flipper lenght is `r mean(penguins_df$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)` mm. 

## Scatter plot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x)
```{r}
ggplot(penguins_df, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm), group = species) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=species), na.rm = TRUE)
```
